The three types are “Lack-type” which cares only about the opcode,
“Immediate-type” which has a 6-bit immediate, and “Register-type” which takes in
3 bits to specify a register. There was originally a jump that looked like an
i-type, but that was cut in favor of using a branch to do the jump type
instruction, instead.

Example of how each instruction typ looks
Instruction         Op       Extra                    Immediate
Search (L-type)    0100     101100 (unimportant)       (none)
bsq (I-type)       1010     (none)                     011010 (6-bit int)
wr(R-type)         0011     011(unimportant)           010 (register)
