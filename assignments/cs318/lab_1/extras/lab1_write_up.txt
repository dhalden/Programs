Lab 1 Write Up

 IXI (Standing for "IXI is XOR Intensive") Is the name of this
architecture. It was created with the goal of having a very low dynamic
instruction count, and without much thought to anything else. In order to
achieve this goal, IXI started out very broad. It had numerous instructions
that were planned to be almost exactly like MIPS instructions, with only 2
instructions that weren't like MIPS instructions. As we started to code the
actual problems, it became clear that certain instructions could either be
gotten rid of, or collapsed into other isntructions. And then it also became
clear that there were new instructions needed.
The decision for the way the 10 bit instructions are divided up, was made at
the beginning of the project. Having at least 8 registers, was imperative, so
it followed that anything involving more than 4 bits for opcodes, was out of
the question. From there, the 4 bit registers were determined by the effect
having more registers had on the evens or odds question. It was discovered
that it became very easy to have a low number of instructions, if one of the
commands handled all of the instruction simultaneously.
