 (I will implement this as skip if equal, and put a jump after it)
 (This will contain something that does 2 sll's on the function)
 *wm (write to memory)                   0110
 *smr (set memory addr to read from)     0111
 *rxor (ripple xor writes to register 1) 1000
 *sdri (set destination register immediate/also set memory addr to read from)

 *luw (from smr)                         1010
 *lqw (from smr)                         1011
 *jump                                   1100
     
     (carry out writes to smw's most recent target)
