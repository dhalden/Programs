1. Can I do what I want to do for the search instruction?
    i.e. add in a load 'quarter' word, increment 2 arbitrary values, and at
    the end of the program make register 4 the new word. Also, instead of
    setting r3 to zero, can I just make the program add a certain amount to
    the program counter?
2. What do you mean by question number 6? and is my emulator okay working the
way it does?
3. for the lab report, do you want more of an essay? or do you want me to
explicitly answer all of the questions?
4. Am I okay to do what I'm doing for my evens or odds code?
4b. Would it be alright if I added something to check if a value is equal to a
different value, and if it is, add a specific number to my program counter in
parallel?
5. How do you want us to store negative numbers?
6. Where exactly does everything need to be stored in memory, and is it
alright if I initialize all of the registers to zero?


This is more as a reminder for me:
Is it alright if I make a command that reads 1 half-word, and writes each
byte to a specific register, while incrementing another register to a specific
value?


Instead of loop unrolling!!!! Just read from memory, and then run your
instruction on the read from memory.

Also: You do not get to start with all of your registers at zero!!!
