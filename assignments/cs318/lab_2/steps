Steps
1. Draw Processor
2. Spreadsheet for control
    for each instruction, decide what every control signal should be.
(in parallel) 
3. get infrastructure/read/understand/modify 
    Put in debug stuff
    Make all of the modules separately, and test them all individually
        Maybe start with fetch logic, and register file logic




By next Wednesday-
Processor Drawn
Table for control signals
tested and finished: 
                ALU
                Fetch(PC + Inst Memory)
                Register File
                Data Memory
