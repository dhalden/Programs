/**
 * This is an example of a subclass of SLController.  Controller uses just a few buttons
 * in the view (and does not use the button grid).  The user can ...
 * 1) enter text in the abPanel and press the aButton to move text to the text area.
 * 2) press the up button to copy the string in the model to the text area.
 * 3) press the down button to copy the string in the text area to the model.
 * 4) press button1 to tell the model to copy its text to the text area. (Similar to 2, but it is
 *    the model that manages the copy, whereas in (2), the controller manages the copy.)
