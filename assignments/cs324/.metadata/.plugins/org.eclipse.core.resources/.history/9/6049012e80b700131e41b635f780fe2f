/**
 * This is a test class used with Controller and Main.  This model provides a setter and
 * getter method so that the controller can access the model's string.  It also provides
 * a writeString method that lets the controller direct the model to copy its string to
 * the view (via the controller).  Note that when the setter/getter is used, the model
 * remains passive, however writeString lets the model determine what to do.
