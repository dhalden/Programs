To make/compile the program:
 $make chill

To run the program: 
Simply run the program with any of the intended inputs.
Anything that is not described in the written prompt should fail
with one of the following errors:
	Error: you entered a non-numeric entry for temperature
	Error: you entered a non-numeric entry for wind speed
	Error: Too many arguments provided
	Error: Temperature must be less than 50.0 degrees Fahrenheit
	Error: Wind velocity must be greater than 0.5 MPH

There is a hierarchy to the order in which you will receive these errors if
you have more than one thing wrong, but it is too complicated explain in 
this readme.


I tried to make no assumptions other than the ones specifically stated 
in the prompt. We'll see if I succeeded.
