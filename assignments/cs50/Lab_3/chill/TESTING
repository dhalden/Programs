I tested the following:
	chill asdf    // improper input
	chill 12 14   // a correct input
	chill -1.4 0.6  // a correct input for both temp, and wind speed
	chill 12.0 		// a correct input for just temperature
	chill 			// standard input
	chill 61 0.1    // both numbers are out of range
	chill 49 0.1    // one of the numbers is fixed
	chill 49 0.51   // both numbers are fixed to be within range
	chill 51		// number is out of range
	chill 0.0 0.0   // corner case because zero is also FALSE in C
	chill 0.0 0.6   // in case the 0.0 would not be caught unless wind speed is with range
	chill 0.0 0.1 0.3 // too many inputs
