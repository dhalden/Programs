Operational semantics-
    1.  describe the meaning of a program by specifying it with more easily
        understood constructs (usually in a lower level language)
        - while(expr)           - label:if(expr)
           {                            {
            //statements                //statements
           }                            goto label
                                        }

axiomatic semantics-
    1. based on formal logic (predicate calculus)
        an assertion before a statement is a precondition
        an assertion after a statement is a postcondition
        {P} is precondition {Q} is post condition
        Ex.
            a = b + 1 {a > 1}
            -Read this as a must be greater than one after this statement 
             executes.
            - One possible precondition: {b > 0}
            - the weakest precondition: {b > 0} is the least restrictive 
              precondition that will guarantee the post condition.
            - more difficult to find weakest precondition in a while loop.
