dynamic - during runtime
static - fixed prior to runtime, and remains the same throughout runtime

Dynamic type binding
    advantages
        flexible - generic program units, doesn't assign types until the program
               runs.
  
    disadvantages
        type error detection by the compiler is difficult or impossible
        compiler can't detect errors involving incorrect assignment of types.

        high cost at runtime, do to type checking.
